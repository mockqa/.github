# What is Mock.qa?

Mock.qa is a cloud service (SaaS) that provides a **production-ready gRPC mocking server** and supports both **gRPC** and **gRPC-web** protocols. 
It offers rich request matching, response templating, and stateful scenarios. You can use a mock for prototyping, development, and testing.  

## Features 

- **Advanced request matching**. Use a wide range of matching methods: RegEx, wildcards, JSON Path, matching against `json` or `yaml` files
- **Easy response templating**. We support yaml and json templates, loaded from a file or in-place templates right here in a `yaml` config file
- **Security**. Mock.qa offers a wide range of gRPC credentials for a channel level and a method level security
- **Observability**. Access your mock.qa usage statistics from your dashboard. The mock.qa statistics are near real-time
- **Stateful behavior**. Mock.qa supports a wide range of test cases based on a scenario-based state machine
- **Continuous deployment**. Mock.qa updates a mock server on each git push you made, so your mock is always up-to-date
